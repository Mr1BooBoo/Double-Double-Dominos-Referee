1. unzip the project file
2. Please place the testing images inside the regular_tasks folder, and make sure that the test images have a name with a similar format as in the training images (ex. 1_01)
3. open the Main.py file and please change the urls to match with the location of the project
4. go to the regular_tasks folder
5. go to the Aligned folder
6. if the program runs as intended there should be the aligned images along side the text file which contains both sides of the domino's location and their value. And at the end the score (just like the training format)
